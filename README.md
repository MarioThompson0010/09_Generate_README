         2. Basic Permissions.

         All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
       copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
       conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
       permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
       covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
       content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
       rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
       
         You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
       convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
       in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
       of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
       with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
       the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
       not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
       for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
       and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
       your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
       
         Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
       the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
       makes it unnecessary.
